            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Recently while scrolling through facebook marketplace I found a post by and old woodworker who was retiring and selling all of his tools and a couple of boards I was in the market for a table saw since I wanted to start more projects and decided to give the boards a home by purchasing some of his tools and building a mid-century walnut lounge chair using traditional woodworking methods and some high quality walnut and maple. </p>

            <h2>Board Selection</h2>
            <p>For the boards I was really trying to get my hands on some walnut since it's generally pretty durable and the guy I bought it from was selling it for very cheap at three dollars a board foot! I also selected some maple for the seat and arm rests since I think walnut and maple compliment each other very well.</p>

            <h2>Making the Base</h2>
            <p>I decided I would start with the base and legs of the chair. I looked up inspiration online and drew out some templates on quarter inch mdf that I cut out with my jigsaw.</p>
            <figure>
                <a href="template">
                  <img src="images/templates.jpg" alt="template" width="400" height="400">
            </figure>
            <figure>
                <a href="base-template">
                  <img src="images/templates_2.jpg" alt="base template" width="400" height="400">
                </a>
                <figcaption>Template I drew out for the base of the chair.</figcaption>
              </figure>
            <p>After cutting out the templates I traced them onto the walnut to ensure that they would fit.</p>
            <figure>
                <a href="tracing">

                </a>
                <figcaption>Tracing the templates onto the walnut.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Once I was sure the pieces would fit I milled down the board to six quarters of an inch. I had to build a routing sled for this since I didn't have a planer.</p>
            <figure>
                <a href="routing-sled">
                  <img src="images/router_sled.jpg" alt="routing sled" width="400" height="400">
                </a>
                <figcaption>Routing sled I built to mill down the boards.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>After milling down the boards I cut out the pieces using my jigsaw and did a test fit before I took them over to the routing table and uses a flush trim bit to get them exactly the same as the templates.</p>
            <figure>
                <a href="base-cutout">
                  <img src="images/test_fit.jpg" alt="base cutout" width="400" height="400">
            </figure>
            <figure>
                <a href="testfit2">
                  <img src="images/test_fit_2.jpg" alt="base cutout" width="400" height="400">
                </a>
            </figure>
            <p>Finally I used dowels to joint the pieces and rounded over the edges.</p>
            <figure>
                <a href="base-finished">
                  <img src="images/trim.jpg" alt="base finished" width="400" height="400">
                </a>
            </figure>
            <p>With the base finished I could now move on to making the seat!</p>
